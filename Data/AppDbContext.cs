// The application now uses Supabase REST API for data access

// Note: Based on the Supabase UI screenshots, table names and column names are in PascalCase
// For example:
// - Tables: "Solos", "DailyGames"
// - Columns: "Id", "Date", "Title", etc.
// This is important for the SupabaseService.cs to construct the correct API URLs
